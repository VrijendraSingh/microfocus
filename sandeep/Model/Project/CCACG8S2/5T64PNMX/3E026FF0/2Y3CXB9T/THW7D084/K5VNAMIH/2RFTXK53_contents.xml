		<comment xml:space="preserve">The default policy assumes that you want to synchronize a subset of the Identity Vault with LDAP. this rule marks events in the given containers for processing by adding the unmatched-src-dn operational property. You can add subtrees in the Identity Vault for inclusion by adding if-src-dn conditionals here. If you are using mirrored placement, the unmatched-src-dn is used later in the placement rule. If you do not use container based scoping, this rule may be modified or removed. If you change this rule, the placement rules must also be changed to reflect your policy.</comment>
