NOVLRSERVB.idmresource.NOVLRSERVBDriverNamePrompt.gcv.dscr.name=Enter the driver name.
NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.use-password-event-values=Use password event values
NOVLRSERVB.globalconfig.NOVLRSERVBMultiThreadSupport.gcv.enable-multithreaded-rrsd=Enable multi-threaded Role and Resource driver
NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.param.max-number-threads=Number of parallel threads for resource requests
NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.use-password-event-values=This control determines the source of the value reported for the nspmDistributionPassword attribute for subscriber channel add and modify events.\n\n Setting the control to false means that the current value of nspmDistributionPassword is obtained and reported as the value of the attribute event. This means that only the current password value is available. This is the default behavior.\n\n Setting the control to true means that the value recorded with the eDirectory event will be decrypted and reported as the value of the attribute event. This means that both the old password value (if it exists) and the replacement password value at the time of the event are available. This is useful for synchronizing passwords to certain applications that require the old password to enable setting a new password.
NOVLRSERVB.idmresource.NOVLRSERVBDriverOptionPrompts.gcv.header.UserApplication/WorkflowConnection=User Application/Workflow Connection
NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.max-migrate-app-count=This control is used to limit the number of application objects that the DirXML Engine will request from an application during a single query that is performed as part of a "migrate objects from application" operation.\n\n If "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError" errors are encountered during a migrate from application operation then this number should be set lower than the default.\n\n Note that this control does not limit the number of application objects that can be migrated; it merely limits the "batch size".
NOVLRSERVB.globalconfig.NOVLRSERVBDGMemberResync.gcv.choice.dg-member-resync-required.false=false
NOVLRSERVB.globalconfig.NOVLRSERVBPurgeResourceHistory.gcv.dscr.cleaup-res-history-last-days=Number of recent days resource history which should be kept while purging.

NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.param.dscr.dyn-group-interval=The frequency in minutes at which dynamic and nested groups that are associated with roles are reevaluated to determine changes in membership.
pkg.name=Role and Resource Service Base
NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.param.choice.enable-parallelization.false=false
NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.set-creators-name=This control is used by the DirXML Engine to determine if the creatorsName attribute should be set to the DN of this driver on all objects created in the Identity Vault by this driver.\n\n Setting the creatorsName attribute allows for easily identifying objects created by this driver, but also carries a performance penalty. If not set, the creatorsName attribute will default to the DN of the NCP Server object that is hosting the driver.
NOVLRSERVB.idmresource.NOVLRSERVBDriverOptionPrompts.gcv.dscr.user-app-url=The URL used to connect to the User Application in order to start Approval Workflows.

NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.param.user-app-identity=User Application Identity
NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.pwd-sync-status=This control determines whether the DirXML Engine will report the status of subscriber channel password change events.\n\n Reporting the status of subscriber channel password change events allows applications such as the Identity Manager User Application to monitor the synchronization progress of a password change that should be synchronized to the connected application.
NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.param.header.Miscellaneous=Miscellaneous
NOVLRSERVB.idmresource.NOVLRSERVBDriverOptionPrompts.gcv.dscr.user-app-password=The password used to authenticate to the User Application in order to start Approval Workflows.
NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.param.dscr.cleanup-req-after-days=Number of days before removing processed request objects

NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.use-pending-association=This control determines whether the DirXML Engine will write a pending association on an object during subscriber channel processing.\n\n Writing a pending association confers little or no benefit but does incur a performance penalty. Nevertheless, the option exists to turn it on for backward compatibility.
NOVLRSERVB.idmresource.NOVLRSERVBDriverOptionPrompts.gcv.user-app-identity=User Application Identity
NOVLRSERVB.globalconfig.NOVLRSERVBMultiThreadSupport.gcv.dscr.allow-driver-start=Specifies whether the driver should start or stop when it encounters an exception while reading unprocessed requests. By default, the value is set to false, which disallows the driver to start if reading the unprocessed requests fails.
NOVLRSERVB.idmresource.NOVLRSERVBDriverOptionPrompts.gcv.user-group-dn=User-Group base container DN
NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.param.dscr.enable-parallelization=Enable to use multiple threads to process resource requests parallely on role assignment

NOVLRSERVB.idmresource.NOVLRSERVBDriverNamePrompt.gcv.name=Driver Name
NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.xslt-bc-mode=This control sets the XSLT processor used by the DirXML Engine to a backwards-compatible mode. The backwards-compatible mode causes the XSLT processor to use one or more behaviors that are not XPath 1.0 and/or XSLT 1.0 standards-compliant. This is done in the interest of backwards-compatiblity with existing DirXML stylesheets that depend on the non-standard behavior(s).\n\n In particular\:\n\n The behavior of the XPath "\!\=" operator when one operand is a node-set and the other operand is other than a node-set is incorrect in DirXML releases up to and including DirXML 2.0 (Novell Identity Manager 2.0). This behavior has been corrected; however, the corrected behavior is disabled by default through this control in favor of backwards-compatibility with existing DirXML stylesheets.
NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.param.dscr.generate-audit-events=Generate audit events to be sent to Novell Audit or Novell Sentinel. This options is only effective if the audit platform agent has been installed on the server hosting this driver and configured to send events to a Secure Logging Server.
NOVLRSERVB.globalconfig.NOVLRSERVBDGMemberResync.gcv.dscr.dg-member-resync-required=Enable resync for dynamic group members while reevaluating dynamic groups.
NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.max-replication-wait=The maximum eDirectory replication wait time controls the maximum time that the DirXML Engine will wait for a particular change to replicate between the local replica and a remote replica. This only affects operations where the DirXML Engine is required to contact a remote eDirectory server in the same tree to perform an operation and may need to wait until some change has replicated to or from the remote server before the operation can be completed (e.g. object moves when the DirXML server does not hold the master replica of the moved object ;file system rights operations for Users created from a template.)
pkg.description=Role and Resource Service Driver Base Package.
NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.param.dscr.user-app-url=The URL used to connect to the User Application in order to start Approval Workflows.
NOVLRSERVB.globalconfig.NOVLRSERVBMultiThreadSupport.gcv.dscr.max-commands-size=Limits the number of commands that the driver storage should store. By default, the value is 500.
NOVLRSERVB.idmresource.NOVLRSERVBDriverOptionPrompts.gcv.uad-dn=User Application Driver DN
NOVLRSERVB.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.max-replication-wait=Maximum eDirectory replication wait time in seconds
